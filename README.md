<br>
'car-price-predictor.zip' folder consists of the flask project
<br>
'car+data.csv' consists the datasets

### Project Execution Steps:
The project was executed in Vs code and command prompt.<br>

- mkdir car-price-predictor (creating a new folder for project)<br>
- cd car-price-predictor (change directory to project folder)
- virtualenv env (creating a virtual environment)
- env\Scripts\activate (activating the virtual environment)
- pip install flask (installing required dependencies)
- pip install scikit-learn (installing required dependencies)
- code . (open the project folder in vs-code)
- python app.py (run the project)
